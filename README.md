# Email Me Today's Weather
A script that sends the current weather information to you.

### Overview
This script sends out an email containing the current weather (weather, temperature, and wind speed) of the city at the specified time.

### Context
I was playing around with the SMTP library on Python and decided to combine it with weather scraping script that I had written a few years ago.

### Usage
First, set up a Gmail account and allow less secure apps to access it as well. Add your email address, password and the  email address you want to send it to to the script. Also add the time at which you want to send the weather and the time difference. When you run it, it will ask for the name of the city.
