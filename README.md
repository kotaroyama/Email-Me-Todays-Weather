# textMeTodayWeather
A script that send the current weather information to your friend

### Overview
This script sends out an email containing the current weather (weather, temperature, and wind speed) of the city at a specific time.

### Context
I was playing around with the SMTP library on Python and decided to combine it with fetch-current-weather (also on my GitHub) that I created a few years ago.

### Usage
First, set up a Gmail account and allow less secure apps to access it also set up. Add your email address, password and the target email address to the script. Also add the time at which you would like to send the weather and the time difference. When you run it, it will ask for the name of the city.
